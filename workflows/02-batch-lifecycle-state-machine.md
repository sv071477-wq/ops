# Batch Lifecycle State Machine

## States

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `Requested` | Initial draft before submission |
| `Approval 1 Pending` | Awaiting first approver decision |
| `Approval 2 Pending` | Awaiting second approver decision |
| `Approved` | Both approval levels completed |
| `Upcoming` | Approved, start date in the future |
| `Ongoing` | Approved, start date has arrived |
| `Pending for Closure` | End date passed, awaiting Gate 2 |
| `Completed` | Gate 2 closed, batch finished |
| `OnHold` | Temporarily paused |
| `Cancelled` | Terminal state, no further transitions |
| `Rejected` | Rejected during approval process |

## Valid Transitions Matrix

```
Requested           → Approval 1 Pending, OnHold, Cancelled
Approval 1 Pending  → Approval 2 Pending, Requested, OnHold, Cancelled
Approval 2 Pending  → Approved, Upcoming, Ongoing, Requested, OnHold, Cancelled
Approved            → Upcoming, Ongoing, OnHold, Cancelled
Upcoming            → Ongoing, OnHold, Cancelled, Approved
Ongoing             → Pending for Closure, OnHold, Cancelled
Pending for Closure → Completed, OnHold, Cancelled
Completed           → OnHold (reopen for corrections)
OnHold              → Requested, Approval 1 Pending, Approval 2 Pending, Approved, Upcoming, Ongoing, Cancelled
Cancelled           → {} (terminal)
Rejected            → Requested, OnHold, Cancelled
```

## Approval Required Statuses

`{Approved, Upcoming, Ongoing, Pending for Closure, Completed}`

These statuses cannot be entered unless both approver levels have approved.

## Create Batch Workflow

### Endpoint: `POST /api/v1/batches`

**Conditions:**
- User must be authenticated
- User role must NOT be Admin
- User team must be "Delivery"
- Both approvers must be configured in `ApprovalConfiguration`
- `batch_id` must be unique
- `start_date >= today`
- `end_date >= start_date`
- `training_days > 0` and `<= calendar_days`
- `total_hours > 0` and `<= training_days * max_hours_per_day`
- `total_enrollments >= 1`
- At least 1 faculty member in `faculty_members`

**Flow:**
1. Validate all business rules
2. Resolve foreign keys: `category_id`, `delivery_mode_id`, `accommodation_id`, `entity_id`
3. Auto-assign `approver_1_id` and `approver_2_id` from global config
4. Set initial status: `Approval 1 Pending`
5. Auto-assign `coordinator_id` if Coordinator creates; `sales_spoc_id` if Sales creates
6. If `delivery_mode` is "Online", clear `location_city`
7. Store `faculty_members` as JSON
8. Create batch record

## Submit for Approval Workflow

### Endpoint: `POST /api/v1/batches/{id}/submit`

**Conditions:**
- Batch must exist and user has operational scope
- Both approvers must be configured
- `start_date` must not have passed

**Flow:**
1. Set `approver_1_id` and `approver_2_id` from config
2. Reset both approver statuses to `Pending`
3. Transition to `Approval 1 Pending`

## Level 1 Approval Workflow

### Endpoint: `POST /api/v1/batches/{id}/approve-level-1`

**Conditions:**
- Current user must be `approver_1` for this batch
- Batch must be in `Approval 1 Pending`

**Flow:**
- `approve`: Set `approver_1_status="Approved"`, `approver_1_approved_at=now`, transition to `Approval 2 Pending`
- `reject`: Set `approver_1_status="Rejected"`, transition to `Requested`, record reason in remarks

## Level 2 Approval Workflow

### Endpoint: `POST /api/v1/batches/{id}/approve-level-2`

**Conditions:**
- Current user must be `approver_2` for this batch
- `approver_1_status` must be `Approved`
- Batch must be in `Approval 2 Pending`

**Flow:**
- `approve`: Set `approver_2_status="Approved"`, `approver_2_approved_at=now`, `is_schema_locked=True`, set `approval_id` from reason (if <= 100 chars), auto-transition to `Upcoming` or `Ongoing` based on `start_date`
- `reject`: Set `approver_2_status="Rejected"`, transition to `Requested`

## Manager Direct Approval Workflow

### Endpoint: `POST /api/v1/batches/{id}/approve`

**Conditions:**
- User must be Manager or Admin
- If not Admin: `approver_1_status` must be `Approved`

**Flow:**
1. Set `approval_id` from request
2. Set `is_schema_locked=True`
3. Auto-transition to `Upcoming` or `Ongoing` based on `start_date`
4. Set `primary_manager_id` to current user if not set

## Lifecycle Status Update Workflow

### Endpoint: `POST /api/v1/batches/{id}/lifecycle-status`

**Conditions:**
- User has operational scope on batch
- Target status is in `VALID_TRANSITIONS` from current status
- If target requires approval (`APPROVAL_REQUIRED_STATUSES`), both approvers must have approved
- Reason is provided (min 3 chars)

**Flow:**
1. Validate transition against `VALID_TRANSITIONS`
2. If target requires approval but not complete, redirect to correct pending status
3. Create audit entry: `[timestamp - Status changed from 'X' to 'Y' by Actor (Role)]: reason`
4. Append to `batch.remarks`
5. If target is `Cancelled`, cascade to all non-terminal sessions (FacultyUtilization and TrainingSession)

## Resume from OnHold Workflow

**Special case:** `POST /api/v1/batches/{id}/lifecycle-status` with `status="Resume"`

**Conditions:**
- Batch must currently be `OnHold`

**Flow:**
- Determines target status based on approval state:
  - `approver_1_status == "Pending"` → `Approval 1 Pending`
  - `approver_1 == "Approved"` and `approver_2 == "Pending"` → `Approval 2 Pending`
  - Any rejected → `Requested`
  - Both approved → `Approved`

## Close Batch (Gate 2) Workflow

### Endpoint: `POST /api/v1/batches/{id}/close`

**Preconditions:**
- `batch_avg_feedback` is not None (at least one rated delivery exists)
- ALL sessions (scheduled + logged) are terminal (`Completed`, `Cancelled`, or `Not Conducted`)

**Flow:**
1. Compute `NPS = ((promoters - detractors) / total) * 100`
2. Store `batch_nps`, `nps_total_responses`, `nps_promoters`, `nps_passives`, `nps_detractors`
3. Set `status="Completed"`, `is_schema_locked=True`
4. Trigger notification

## Auto-Transition Rules (Scheduler)

### Daily at 00:30 IST

- `Upcoming` + `start_date <= today` → `Ongoing`
- `Ongoing` + `end_date < today` → `Pending for Closure`

## Schema Lock Conditions

Once `is_schema_locked=True`:
- Only Admin, Manager, or Coordinator can modify
- Restricted fields for non-admin/manager: `client_name`, `category`, `program_name`, `technology`, `domain`
- Finance team can update finance fields regardless

## Finance Status Conditions

Only Finance team or Admin can update:
- `finance_status` (Pending or Cleared)
- `finance_status_check_date`
- `finance_check`

## Approval Configuration

The `approval_configurations` table stores global approver settings:
- `approver_1_id` (FK to users.id)
- `approver_2_id` (FK to users.id)
- `updated_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ)
