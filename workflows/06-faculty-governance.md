# Faculty Governance Workflows

## Faculty Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Internal Full-time` | Company employees |
| `External Consultant` | Contract faculty |
| `HOP` | Head of Program / guest faculty |

## Domains

| Domain | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `IT/ITES` | IT and IT Enabled Services |
| `Cloud` | Cloud technologies |
| `DS/ML` | Data Science / Machine Learning |
| `CyberSecurity` | Security focus |
| `FullStack` | Full stack development |

## Faculty Resolution

When logging a utilization record, the system resolves the faculty name:

1. If `faculty_id` provided: look up active user by ID, use `full_name`
2. If `faculty_name` provided:
   - Try exact match on `User.full_name` with `role="Faculty"`
   - Try ilike match on `User.full_name` with `role="Faculty"`
   - Try exact match on `User.full_name` (any active user)
   - Try ilike match on `User.full_name` (any active user)
3. If no match found: use the provided name as free-text
4. If no name provided at all: return 422 error

## Faculty Utilization Overview

### Endpoint: `GET /api/v1/faculty/utilization`

**Computed fields:**
- `total_faculty_count`: Active users with `role="Faculty"`
- `active_deployed_faculty`: Distinct faculty names in non-cancelled utilizations that match the faculty roster (case-insensitive)
- `overall_utilization_percentage`: `(active_deployed / total_faculty) * 100`, rounded to 1 decimal
- `domain_breakdown`: For each domain:
  - `faculty_count`: Distinct faculty names in non-cancelled deliveries for batches with matching domain
  - `hours_scheduled`: Sum of `no_of_hours` for non-cancelled deliveries

## Faculty Utilization Export

### Endpoint: `GET /api/v1/faculty/utilization/export`

**Filters:**
- `faculty_type`: Joins `FacultyType` table to filter by name
- `start_date` / `end_date`: Filters `date_of_training` range

**Columns:**
Date, Faculty Name, Faculty Type, Topic, Hours, City, Venue, Mode, Status, Feedback Rating, Feedback Notes, Outcome Reason, Outcome At

## FMS Sync Workflow

### Endpoint: `POST /api/v1/integrations/fms/sync`

**Conditions:**
- User must be Admin

**Current Behavior:**
- Returns mock success response: `{"status": "SUCCESS", "message": "FMS sync event ... dispatched"}`
- Does NOT actually call external FMS API
- `FMS_API_BASE_URL` and `FMS_API_KEY` config vars exist but are unused

## FMS Logs

### Endpoint: `GET /api/v1/integrations/fms/logs`

**Conditions:**
- User must be Admin

**Current Behavior:**
- Returns empty list (no persistence table yet)
